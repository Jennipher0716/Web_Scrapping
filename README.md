# Gnod Song Predictor

In this project, a music predictor for songs from BillBoard Top100, TopCharts 100(singles) and Spotify playlist The Swingimg Turtle was developed. 


This input was transformed into a .csv file that is used as data for a music predictor. 

Further, unsupervised Machine Learning model to build a k-means model based on audio features from Spotify registered songs (danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness,acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) where 18 clusters were generated.
